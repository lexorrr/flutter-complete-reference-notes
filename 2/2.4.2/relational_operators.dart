  // 2.4.2 Relational operators
  // Equality and relational operators are used in boolean expression,
  // generally inside if statements or as a stop condition of a
  // while loop.
  // Symbol    Meaning                                  Example
  // ==        Equality test                            2 == 6
  // !=        Inequality test                          2 != 6
  // >         Greater than                             2 > 6
  // <         Smaller than                             2 < 6
  // >=        Greater or equal to                      2 >= 6
  // <=        Smaller or equal to                      2 <= 6

  // Testing the equality of two objects a and b always happens
  // with the == operator because, unlike Java or C#, there
  // is no equals() method. In general here's how the == works:
  // 1. If a or b is null, return true if both are null or false
  // if only one is null. Otherwise...
  // 2. ... return the result of == according with the logic you've
  // defined in the method override.
  // Of course, == works only with objects of the same type.
